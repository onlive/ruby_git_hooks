# Copy files from ~/.git_hooks into .git/hooks in the current repo.

# This script is run by Git, and can wind up running in system Ruby,
# so it should be as 1.8-compatible and low on dependencies as
# possible.  I will be so, so happy when Ruby 1.8 is effectively
# dead.

# Note that we copy files that aren't names of hooks on purpose.
# It's totally kosher to have required or symlinked Ruby scripts
# and other stuff in the ~/.git_hooks dir.  It's also totally
# kosher to use RubyGitHooks support for git clone with hooks
# even if you don't use RGH for anything else.
