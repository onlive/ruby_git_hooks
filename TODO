* Debug various cases for first commit in new repo.

* Add more hook types

* Wire up pre-rebase hooks to allow validations for multi-file
  criteria.  Then you can't rebase in a new file if it would violate
  the CaseClashHook, say.

* Document built-in hooks like CopyrightCheck

* Add base hook class for a hook that checks (pre-commit, pre-receive)
  and notifies (post-commit, post-receive) plus eventually vets
  rebases (pre-rebase).  Basically, there's a whole lifecycle here and
  right now it's all disconnected.

* Document, document, document
