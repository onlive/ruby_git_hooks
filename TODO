* Debug various cases for first commit in new repo.

* Grit

* "Illegal content" hook -- for catching incomplete merges (">>>>>>"), etc.

* "Bundle install on pull" hook

* Wire up pre-rebase hooks to allow validations for multi-file
  criteria.  Then you can't rebase in a new file if it would violate
  the CaseClashHook, say.

* Document built-in hooks like CopyrightCheck

* Add base hook class for a hook that checks (pre-commit, pre-receive)
  and notifies (post-commit, post-receive) plus eventually vets
  rebases (pre-rebase).  Basically, there's a whole lifecycle here and
  right now it's all disconnected.

* Document, document, document

* Register with default hook list and file types, and by default only
  run if those match.

* Add option registration to Hook parent class and do appropriate
  string/symbol checking there.

* Print message if a hook is registered but run is never called.
